What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
One of my biggest struggles was troubleshooting a merge conflict.
What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
How to trouble shoot a merge conflict. What a pairing session looks like. How to give feedback. As well as, how to use github more efficiently.
What questions did you ask your pair and the guide? 
I asked more about the github process and how it all works. I wasn't sure where to find the license at first.
What still confuses you about Git?
I think when I want use git fetch/merge and git pull.
How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
It started out pretty rocky figuring out roles and how to work together but as we continued we gained momentum and really started to get things done. I would say it was a pretty good experience overall.
